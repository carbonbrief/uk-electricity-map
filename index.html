                    <p>Today, <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-uk-electricity-generation-2018-falls-to-lowest-since-1994">more than half</a> the UK&rsquo;s electricity comes from low-carbon sources such as solar, wind and nuclear.</p>
                    <p>The country has cleaned up its electricity grid <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/guest-post-ten-charts-show-how-the-world-is-progressing-on-clean-energy">faster</a> than any other major world economy. Its targets to <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/countdown-to-2025-tracking-the-uk-coal-phase-out">phase out coal</a> by 2025 and largely decarbonise the grid by 2030 could be met <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-half-uks-electricity-to-be-renewable-by-2025"> years ahead of schedule</a>.</p>
                    <p>The grid in Great Britain recently ran for a record eight-day stretch <a href="https://twitter.com/CarbonBrief/status/1126100435188760576">without burning coal</span></a>&ndash;&nbsp;the first time this has happened <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/uk-coal-use-to-fall-to-lowest-level-since-industrial-revolution">since 1882</a> &ndash;&nbsp;and coal generates less than 5% of the mix overall.</p>
                    <p>But just ten years ago, as parliament was passing the Climate Change Act in 2008, some four fifths of the electricity generated in the UK came from fossil fuels &ndash; and activists were <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/may/18/carbonemissions.energy">resisting plans</a> for a new fleet of coal-fired power stations. Emissions from the power sector had <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-half-uks-electricity-to-be-renewable-by-2025">barely changed</a> for years, making it the largest contributor to the UK&rsquo;s total.</p>
                    <p>This interactive tells the story of how the UK&rsquo;s electricity system has been transformed in a decade &ndash; and how it is expected to continue changing in future.</span></p>

                            <p>In April, the 1,000MW &ldquo;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/apr/11/uk-netherlands-power-cable-britned">BritNed</a>&rdquo; electricity interconnector opens between the UK and the Netherlands. It joins the 2,000MW link to France, which opened in 1986, and a 500MW link between Britain and Northern Ireland.</p>
                            <p>In May, the coalition agrees the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/may/17/uk-government-emissions-targets">fourth carbon budget</a> target of cutting emissions in half by 2023-2027, compared to 1990 levels. The budget had been subject to &ldquo;<a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/the-carbon-brief-interview-ed-davey">a bit of a war</a>&rdquo; between the Treasury and DECC, with DECC ultimately securing the target in line with <a href="https://www.theccc.org.uk/publication/the-fourth-carbon-budget-reducing-emissions-through-the-2020s-2/">CCC advice</a>. </p>
                            <p>In June, the government publishes a series of &ldquo;<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-policy-statements-for-energy-infrastructure">national policy statements</a>&rdquo; on energy infrastructure. The statement on <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/47859/2009-nps-for-nuclear-volumeI.pdf">nuclear power</a> identifies eight sites as suitable for new reactors, to be built &ldquo;before the end of 2025&rdquo;. <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-13887579">BBC News</a> reports the announcement, noting it comes &ldquo;three months after the <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-the-legacy-of-the-fukushima-nuclear-disaster">Fukushima disaster</a> in Japan&rdquo;.</p>
                            <p>In July, the government&rsquo;s &ldquo;electricity market reform&rdquo; (EMR) plans are published in a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/planning-our-electric-future-a-white-paper-for-secure-affordable-and-low-carbon-energy">white paper</a> that targets &ldquo;secure, affordable and low-carbon electricity&rdquo;. This warns that 20GW of capacity&nbsp;&ndash; a quarter of the UK total &ndash; is to close within a decade, &ldquo;increasing the likelihood of blackouts&rdquo;. It proposes new &ldquo;<a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/uk-renewables-auction-pushes-down-costs">contracts for difference</a>&rdquo; (CfDs) to support low-carbon generation via competitive auctions, as well as a &ldquo;<a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/factcheck-carbon-floor-price-household-energy-bills">carbon price floor</a>&rdquo; &ndash;&nbsp;a minimum the cost for power sector emissions &ndash;&nbsp;and a &ldquo;<a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/qa-what-next-for-uk-capacity-market-after-surprise-eu-ruling">capacity mechanism</a>&rdquo; to guarantee security of supply.</p>
                            <p>Alongside the EMR white paper the &ldquo;<a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/48128/2167-uk-renewable-energy-roadmap.pdf">renewable energy roadmap</a>&rdquo; explains how the UK government will meet the EU target of a 15% renewable energy share by 2020. It sets a target for the cost of offshore wind to fall to &pound;100 per megawatt hour (MWh) by 2020. This benchmark becomes a yardstick for the approval of the Hinkley C new nuclear plant at &pound;92.50/MWh.</p>
                            <p>In December, the government publishes its &ldquo;<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-carbon-plan-reducing-greenhouse-gas-emissions--2">carbon plan</a>&rdquo; for meeting the fourth carbon budget. It says most coal-fired power stations will close by 2020 and asks: &ldquo;Will wind, CCS or nuclear be the cheapest method of generating large-scale low carbon electricity?&rdquo; Renewable costs go on to fall <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-uk-auction-offshore-wind-cheaper-than-new-gas">far faster than expected</a> such that nuclear is &ndash; in the words of business secretary Greg Clark &ndash;&nbsp;&ldquo;<a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2019-01-17/debates/9C841326-B63A-4790-867F-905DEDDDD8AC/NuclearUpdate#">outcompeted</a>&rdquo; on price. Debate shifts towards <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/in-depth-whole-system-costs-renewables">grid integration</a>, the benefits of a mix of different technologies and the <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/qa-can-the-uk-meet-its-climate-goals-without-the-wylfa-nuclear-plant">need to cope</a> with extended periods of low wind generation.</p>

                            <p>In 2012, the carbon intensity of UK electricity generation leaps by 10% to 484gCO2/kWh, as market prices drive a switch from gas to coal. The dirtiest fossil fuel generates 39% of the UK mix, up from 30% in 2011 and its <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/279523/DUKES_2013_published_version.pdf">highest share since 1996</a>.</p>
                            <p>In January, Conservative backbencher Chris Heaton-Harris organises a <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/energy/windpower/9061554/Full-letter-from-MPs-to-David-Cameron-on-wind-power-subsidies.html">letter to the prime minister</a> demanding a &ldquo;dramatic&rdquo; cut in subsidies for onshore wind. It is signed by more than 100 other MPs, mostly also Conservatives. The coalition government is &ldquo;<a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/coalition-at-war-over-wind-farms-smnj0bhpmgl">at war</a>&rdquo; over onshore wind for much of the year, with Conservative energy minister John Hayes briefing front pages in the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/energy/9644558/Death-knell-for-wind-farms-Enough-is-Enough-says-minister.html">Daily Telegraph</a> (&ldquo;Death knell for wind farms&rdquo;) and <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2225531/Minister-signals-end-wind-farm-We-pepper-turbines-country--declares-energy-minister.html">Daily Mail</a> (&ldquo;Minister signals end of the wind farm&rdquo;).</p>

                            <p>In February, Oldbury nuclear power plant <a href="https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130628105854/https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/digest-of-united-kingdom-energy-statistics-dukes-2012-printed-version-excluding-cover-pages">closes down</a> after 44 years. The site in Somerset was the world&rsquo;s oldest operating nuclear plant, having opened in 1967.</p>
                            <p>In October, a <a href="https://reason.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/thelimitsofwindpower.pdf">report</a> for the &ldquo;libertarian&rdquo; US thinktank the <a href="https://reason.org/">Reason Foundation</a> argues there is a 10% &ldquo;practical upper limit&rdquo; to the share of electricity generated by windfarms. The report, later <a href="http://www.windwatchni.com/uploads/1/6/4/9/16490250/_thelimitsofwindpowerstudy-adamsmithinstitute.pdf">republished</a> with the free-market UK thinktank the <a href="https://www.adamsmith.org/">Adam Smith Institute</a>, cites barriers including the need for storage and a &ldquo;decrease in grid reliability&rdquo;. UK wind goes on to comfortably surpass this supposed limit in 2015, without incident.</p>
                            <p>In December, two major power plants close after choosing not to upgrade to meet EU air pollution rules under the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/archives/industry/stationary/lcp/legislation.htm">Large Combustion Plants Directive</a>. One is the 1,940MW Kingsnorth coal plant in Kent, where protestors had scaled the chimney in 2007. The other is the 1,300MW oil-fired plant at Grain, also in Kent. They are <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/279523/DUKES_2013_published_version.pdf">followed</a> by several more <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/the-uks-power-plant-graveyards-what-where-and-why">closures</a> during 2013.</p>
                            <p>Around the same time, two large gas plants are completed: a 2,199MW site at <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-west-wales-19639091">Pembroke</a> on the coast of south Wales and a 1,332MW station at <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-20157721">West Burton</a> in Nottinghamshire. The latter is occupied by &ldquo;<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-20157721">No Dash for Gas</a>&rdquo; protestors, delaying the start of operations into 2013. The new sites join four other large gas plants that had opened in 2010. Severn Power&rsquo;s 850MW, Staythorpe C&rsquo;s 1,772MW, Langage&rsquo;s 905MW and the 1,365MW Grain combined heat and power scheme take the total of new gas capacity to 8.4GW opened in the space of just three years. (Some 8GW of large new gas plants had opened in the decade to 2010.)</p>
                            <p>The government&rsquo;s new &ldquo;<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/gas-generation-strategy">gas generation strategy</a>&rdquo; says up to another 26GW of new gas-fired power stations could still be needed by 2030 &ldquo;in part to replace older coal, gas and nuclear plant as it retires&rdquo;. The strategy, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/dec/05/gas-strategy-unveiled-george-osborne">unveiled</a> by chancellor George Osborne, is linked to support for fracking and says as much as 37GW could be needed if climate goals are relaxed. This level of new gas is branded &ldquo;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/dec/04/gas-strategy-plan-z-climate-adviser">completely incompatible</a>&rdquo; with UK carbon budgets by the head of the CCC, who does however support the 26GW scenario. [Only one large new gas plant goes on to be built by 2019.]</p>
