                    <p class="instructions">This interactive article shows how the UK has transformed its electricity supply in a decade &ndash; and how things are expected to continue changing.</p>
                    <p class="instructions">To tell this story of unprecedented change, Carbon Brief has mapped every power plant in the UK, in each year since 2008, as well as taken a look into the future. From the smallest solar rooftop to the largest coal-fired giant, this UK map is the most comprehensive ever published, containing nearly 3,000 larger sites and more than 800,000 smaller ones.</p>
                    <p class="instructions">Scroll through the years to see how &ndash;&nbsp;and why &ndash;&nbsp;the map has changed. Skip to the end for the <a href="#endmap">full interactive map</a> and the <a href="#credits">methodology</a> behind the data.</p>
                    <p class="centered no-gaps">-----------------</p>
                    <p>Back in 2008, as the Climate Change Act was becoming law, some four-fifths of the UK&rsquo;s electricity came from fossil fuels &ndash; and climate campaigners were <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/may/18/carbonemissions.energy">resisting plans</a> for a new fleet of coal-fired power stations. Emissions from the sector had <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-half-uks-electricity-to-be-renewable-by-2025">barely changed</a> for years, making it the largest contributor to the UK&rsquo;s total by far.</p>
                    <p>Since then, the UK has cleaned up its electricity mix <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/guest-post-ten-charts-show-how-the-world-is-progressing-on-clean-energy">faster</a> than any other major world economy. Coal-fired power has virtually disappeared and even gas use is down by a quarter. Instead, the country now gets <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-uk-electricity-generation-2018-falls-to-lowest-since-1994">more than half</a> of its electricity from low-carbon sources, such as solar, wind and nuclear. Renewables have filled the gap left by fossil fuels, along with falling electricity demand.</p>
                    <p>All this means the government&rsquo;s targets to <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/countdown-to-2025-tracking-the-uk-coal-phase-out">phase out coal</a> by 2025 and largely decarbonise the grid by 2030 could be met <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-half-uks-electricity-to-be-renewable-by-2025">years ahead of schedule</a>. The grid in Great Britain recently ran for a record <a href="https://twitter.com/UK_Coal/status/1136008160567877633">18 days</a> straight <a href="https://twitter.com/CarbonBrief/status/1126100435188760576">without burning coal</a> &ndash;&nbsp;the first time this has happened <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/uk-coal-use-to-fall-to-lowest-level-since-industrial-revolution">since 1882</a> &ndash;&nbsp;and coal generates <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-uk-electricity-generation-2018-falls-to-lowest-since-1994">less than 5%</a> of the mix overall.</p>
                    <p>This is the story of the policy decisions and other developments behind the UK electricity sector&rsquo;s decade of transformation.</p>

                            <p>In 2008, each kilowatt hour of electricity generated in the UK adds 495 grammes of CO2 to the atmosphere (gCO2/kWh). This important metric&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;the &ldquo;carbon intensity&rdquo; of the electricity system &ndash; is to fall by nearly 60% by 2018.

In one of his first acts at the head of government, Cameron visits the Department of Energy and Climate Change and pledges to lead the &ldquo;<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pms-speech-at-decc">greenest government ever</a>&rdquo;, in a speech delivered to officials while standing on a desk. The <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/78977/coalition_programme_for_government.pdf">coalition agreement</a> signals the introduction of a minimum &ldquo;floor price&rdquo; for carbon emissions.</p>

The idea has been in development <a href="https://www.e3g.org/library/green-investment-bank-the-history">since 2008</a> and was backed by the then Labour government earlier in 2010. Osborne&rsquo;s <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/248096/0061.pdf">budget</a> also announces a &ldquo;<a href="https://www.gov.uk/green-deal-energy-saving-measures">Green Deal</a>&rdquo; scheme to boost home energy efficiency. It launches in 2013 alongside wider reforms to energy efficiency policy. The number of efficiency improvements subsequently <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/uk-homes-shockingly-unprepared-for-climate-change-says-ccc">plummets</a> and the Green Deal is later <a href="https://www.nao.org.uk/report/green-deal-and-energy-company-obligation/">judged a failure</a>.</p>

                            <p>In July, the government&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href="https://www.emrsettlement.co.uk/about-emr/">electricity market reform</a>&rdquo; (EMR) plans are published in a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/planning-our-electric-future-a-white-paper-for-secure-affordable-and-low-carbon-energy">white paper</a> that targets &ldquo;secure, affordable and low-carbon electricity&rdquo;. This warns that 20GW of capacity&nbsp;&ndash; a quarter of the UK total &ndash; is to close within a decade, &ldquo;increasing the likelihood of blackouts&rdquo;. It proposes new &ldquo;<a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/uk-renewables-auction-pushes-down-costs">contracts for difference</a>&rdquo; (CfDs) to support low-carbon generation via competitive auctions, as well as a &ldquo;<a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/factcheck-carbon-floor-price-household-energy-bills">carbon price floor</a>&rdquo; &ndash;&nbsp;a minimum cost for power-sector emissions &ndash;&nbsp;and a &ldquo;<a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/qa-what-next-for-uk-capacity-market-after-surprise-eu-ruling">capacity mechanism</a>&rdquo; to guarantee security of supply.</p>

It sets a target for the cost of offshore wind to fall to &pound;100 per megawatt hour (MWh) by 2020. This target later becomes a benchmark for the cost of the Hinkley C new nuclear plant.</p>
                            <p>In December, the government publishes its &ldquo;<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-carbon-plan-reducing-greenhouse-gas-emissions--2">carbon plan</a>&rdquo; for meeting the fourth carbon budget.

Lib Dem energy and climate secretary Ed Davey had said it would be &ldquo;reckless&rdquo; to oppose new nuclear in the face of a warming planet. The next month, the government <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/00eff456-3979-11e3-a3a4-00144feab7de">signs a deal</a> with French energy giant EDF to build the <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/the-hinkley-c-new-nuclear-plant">Hinkley C</a> new nuclear plant for &pound;92.50/MWh. It will be the UK&rsquo;s first new nuclear plant since Sizewell B was completed in 1995.</p>

The freeze kicks in only after the tax increases to &pound;9/tCO2 in April and then doubles to &pound;18/t in April 2015, helping drive rapid declines in coal-fired electricity generation.</p>
                            <p>Meanwhile, demand for electricity defies the experts by <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/450302/DUKES_2015.pdf">continuing to fall</a>, due to a <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/a-detailed-look-at-why-uk-homes-are-using-less-energy">poorly-understood</a> mixture of <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-uk-electricity-generation-2018-falls-to-lowest-since-1994">energy efficiency</a> policy, higher prices and other factors.

The projects are awarded contracts without competitive auction, leading to criticism from <a href="https://www.nao.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Early-contracts-for-renewable-electricity1.pdf">government auditors</a>.</p>
                            <p>In October, EU leaders reach a <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/qa-the-eus-2030-climate-targets">compromise deal</a> on climate goals for 2030, including cutting emissions by &ldquo;at least&rdquo; 40% relative to 1990 levels while getting 27% of energy from renewables and cutting energy use by 27% relative to the current trajectory.

Later that month, 27 renewable schemes totalling 2.1GW of capacity secure support at the first competitive CfD auction. Prices are <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/uk-renewables-auction-pushes-down-costs">far below</a> what had been expected. Meanwhile, UK solar capacity nearly doubles to reach 10GW, as developers rush to beat a <a href="https://www.bclplaw.com/en-US/thought-leadership/renewables-update-renewables-obligation-to-close-to-large-scale-solar.html">subsidy deadline</a> at the end of March.</p>
                            <p>In May, the Conservatives win a <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/updated-election-2015-what-will-a-conservative-majority-mean-for-climate-and-energy">surprise majority</a> in the general election, signalling a major <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/election-2015-what-the-manifestos-say-on-climate-and-energy">change of direction</a> for UK energy policy. In June, new Conservative energy and climate change secretary Amber Rudd gives a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/statement-on-ending-subsidies-for-onshore-wind">statement</a> on &ldquo;ending subsidies for onshore wind&rdquo;, after an election manifesto commitment to &ldquo;halt the spread&rdquo; of onshore windfarms.</p>

The surprise decision removes what has effectively been a &pound;5 per megawatt hour subsidy to renewables, causing shares in some firms to <a href="https://www.londonstockexchange.com/exchange/prices-and-markets/stocks/summary/company-summary-chart.html?fourWayKey=GB00B1VNSX38GBGBXSTMM">plunge</a>. The government then <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/decc-amber-rudd-reduces-subsidies-for-renewable-energy">unveils</a> a series of subsidy cuts and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-energy-bill-201516">other restrictions</a> for the cheapest renewable technologies &ndash; onshore wind and solar &ndash; in what it says is an effort to limit household <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/qa-has-the-uk-blown-its-green-power-budget">energy bills</a>. Some of these changes are enacted via the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-energy-bill-201516">Energy Bill 2015/16</a>.</p>
                            <p>In November, Rudd announces &ldquo;<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/amber-rudds-speech-on-a-new-direction-for-uk-energy-policy">a new direction for UK energy policy</a>&rdquo;. Her &ldquo;reset&rdquo; speech shifts the emphasis for UK policy by saying &ndash;&nbsp;three times &ndash;&nbsp;that &ldquo;energy security has to be the number one priority&rdquo;. She also pledges to <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/in-depth-uk-pledges-coal-phase-out-by-2025-but-uncertainty-remains">phase out coal-fired power</a> by 2025&nbsp;&ldquo;if we&rsquo;re confident that the shift to new gas can be achieved within these timescales&rdquo;. Rudd adds that it is &ldquo;imperative&rdquo; for the UK to build more than one new nuclear plant and lends support for &ldquo;up to 10GW&rdquo; of offshore wind to be built in the 2020s.</p>
                            <p>Soon after, the &pound;1bn government competition to support carbon capture and storage is <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-34357804">axed</a>.</p>

A series of scare stories in the runup to the news <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/factcheck-how-much-power-will-uk-electric-vehicles-need">inaccurately suggest</a> the UK will need as many as 20 new nuclear plants to cope with the demand from electric vehicles. <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/factcheck-misleading-headlines-about-electric-car-charging-while-boiling-the-kettle">Negative coverage</a> continues through the summer.</p>
                            <p>In September, the government announces results from its second &ldquo;contracts for difference&rdquo; auction. Two offshore windfarms <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-uk-auction-offshore-wind-cheaper-than-new-gas">spectacularly beat expectations</a>, winning contracts for the early 2020s at &pound;57.50 per megawatt hour&nbsp;&ndash; cheaper than the projected cost of new gas-fired power. As Carbon Brief notes at the time:</p>
                            <p class="long-quote">&ldquo;The auction results [for offshore wind] shift the conversation, from renewables being expensive, towards how cheap, variable zero-carbon power can be integrated into the grid, while maintaining sufficient supplies of power throughout the year.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>In October, the government publishes its long-awaited <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/in-depth-how-the-clean-growth-strategy-hopes-to-deliver-uk-climate-goals">Clean Growth Strategy</a> setting out how the UK will meet its fourth and fifth carbon budgets for 2023-2032. This includes a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-carbon-capture-and-storage-government-funding-and-support">new approach to CCS</a> &ldquo;designed to&hellip;ensure the government has the option of deploying CCUS at scale during the 2030s, subject to costs coming down sufficiently&rdquo;. The policy ambition needed to meet the strategy&rsquo;s aims are <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/uk-will-miss-climate-goals-despite-new-strategy-says-official-watchdog">still lacking</a> across the board, according to government advisers.</p>
                            <p>The <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/autumn-budget-2017-key-climate-energy-announcements">budget</a> in November includes a replacement for the LCF &ndash; an <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/660986/Control_for_Low_Carbon_Levies_web.pdf">effective moratorium</a> on new support for low-carbon electricity beyond the already-committed &pound;557m earmarked for offshore wind. The budget leaves the door open to &ldquo;<a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/what-does-subsidy-free-renewables-actually-mean">subsidy-free</a>&rdquo; support, but this is not pursued.</p>
                            <p>Reforms to the <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/qa-will-reformed-eu-emissions-trading-system-raise-carbon-prices">EU Emissions Trading System</a> (EU ETS) spark a strong increase in <a href="https://sandbag.org.uk/carbon-price-viewer/">carbon prices</a>, putting a further squeeze on coal-fired power stations in the UK and <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/eu-got-less-electricity-from-coal-than-renewables-2017">beyond</a>.</p>

                            <p>In 2018, the carbon intensity of UK electricity generation falls again to just 207gCO2/kWh &ndash;&nbsp;a reduction of nearly 60% compared to 495g in 2008 and more than half since 484g in 2012.</p>

                            <p>There are just seven <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/countdown-to-2025-tracking-the-uk-coal-phase-out"><span class="highlight coal">coal</span> plants remaining</a> in the UK supplying <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-uk-electricity-generation-2018-falls-to-lowest-since-1994">less than 5%</a> of the electricity mix. Gas generation has been ever-present and meets nearly 40% of&nbsp;UK demand&nbsp;&ndash; but its output has declined, too, falling 25% since 2008. Nuclear still supplies around a fifth of the total.</p>
                            <p>Coal capacity has shrunk from 32GW in 2008 to just 12GW, with another 2GW set to close in 2019. In contrast, the UK&rsquo;s wind and solar capacity has exploded. Solar has gone from being close to zero in 2008 to 13GW, while wind has increased six-fold from 3.6GW to nearly 22GW. The capacity of the country&rsquo;s gas and biomass power plants has also gone up by around 5GW each. Meanwhile, more than 700 megawatts (0.7GW) of battery storage capacity has been built in the space of two years, with another 220MW in the pipeline.</p>

                            <p>In 2008, just 56 major power plants burning coal, oil, gas or nuclear fuel generated the vast majority of UK electricity and the roughly 500 large renewable sites around the country contributed only 6% to the mix. Now, there are nearly 3,000 large renewable schemes and more than 800,000 small sites, collectively generating more than a third of the mix.</p>

                            <p>The <a href="https://www.theccc.org.uk/">Committee on Climate Change</a>, the government&rsquo;s official climate adviser, publishes two significant reports. One suggests the UK should &ldquo;<a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/ccc-uk-should-move-away-from-large-scale-biomass-burning">move away</a>&rdquo; from the large-scale burning of <span class="highlight biomass">biomass</span> to generate electricity, once existing subsidy contracts for sites such as Drax in Yorkshire and Lynemouth in Northumberland expire in 2027. The other says it could be <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/ccc-new-uk-renewables-could-be-cheaper-than-existing-gas-plants-by-2030">cheaper to build new renewables</a> in the 2020s than to keep running existing gas plants.</p>

                            <p>Meanwhile, the <a href="https://www.nic.org.uk/">National Infrastructure Commission</a> says a &ldquo;<a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/in-depth-uk-can-go-low-carbon-at-no-extra-cost-say-infrastructure-advisors">quiet revolution</a>&rdquo; in renewable costs means government should prioritise wind and solar, alongside energy efficiency, as it looks to the low-carbon economy of the future. In June, the government agrees a &ldquo;<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-deal-with-industry-to-secure-uk-civil-nuclear-future-and-drive-down-cost-of-energy-for-customers">sector deal</a>&rdquo; with the nuclear industry, which commits to &ldquo;reduce the cost of new nuclear build projects by 30% by 2030&rdquo;. [It does not say what this is compared to.] </p>
                            <p>In November, business secretary Greg Clark gives a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/after-the-trilemma-4-principles-for-the-power-sector">speech</a> proclaiming the imminent &ldquo;end of the trilemma&rdquo;. The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/energy-policy-now-and-the-direction-its-headed">trilemma</a> was the idea that electricity supplies can meet only two out three competing priorities: cheap, secure or low-carbon. This trade-off will be &ldquo;well and truly over&rdquo; by the mid-2020s, Clark says, as &ldquo;green power will be the cheapest&rdquo;.</p>
                            <p>The shift in rhetoric continues when Clark explains to parliament in early 2019 why the <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/qa-can-the-uk-meet-its-climate-goals-without-the-wylfa-nuclear-plant">Wylfa new nuclear</a> plant in Wales will not be going ahead despite strong continued government support for the technology. Clark says:</p>
                            <p class="long-quote">&ldquo;The economics of the energy market have changed significantly in recent years. The cost of renewable technologies such as offshore wind has fallen dramatically&hellip;The challenge of financing new nuclear is one of falling costs and greater abundance of alternative technologies, which means that nuclear is being outcompeted.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>In the first half of 2019, Great Britain extends its record for running without coal-fired electricity, first to <a href="https://twitter.com/CarbonBrief/status/1126100435188760576">one week</a>, then <a href="https://twitter.com/CarbonBrief/status/1134462774350962690">two weeks</a>, then <a href="https://twitter.com/UK_Coal/status/1136008160567877633">18 days</a> in a stretch.</p>

                            <p>The past decade of transformation in the UK&rsquo;s electricity sector is a prelude to much greater change in the years to come, as the country moves towards the zero-carbon grid that will be needed to meet a recommended long-term climate goal of reaching <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/in-depth-the-uk-should-reach-net-zero-climate-goal-by-2050-says-ccc">net-zero emissions by 2050</a>.</p>
                            <p>Since 2008, electricity demand has fallen to its <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-uk-electricity-generation-2018-falls-to-lowest-since-1994">lowest level in decades</a>, thanks to energy efficiency policies and other factors, easing the transition away from fossil fuels.

                    <h2>Methdology</h2>
                    <p>The interactive map is based on six separate data sources processed and then combined using <a href="https://github.com/DrSimEvans/uk-electricity-map">bespoke Python code</a>. While all attempts have been made to capture as complete a picture as possible of the UK electricity system, the overlapping and often incomplete data sources make this challenging. <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/contact-us">Please get in touch</a> regarding any errors or omissions.</p>
                    <p>In total, the map includes 2,855 individual currently operating sites, of which 2,655 are renewable. The map also includes nearly 840,000 small-scale renewable installations aggregated by fuel at local authority level. Some 15 current or planned interconnectors are also included on the map.</p>
                    <p>Each power plant is represented on the map by a circle, with radius loosely proportional to its capacity. There is also a minimum circle size so that all are visible. The line chart on the final map shows annual electricity generation by fuel (desktop only).</p>
                    <p>Data on conventional power plants of at least 1MW capacity, operated by &ldquo;<a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/736148/DUKES_2018.pdf">major power producers</a>&rdquo; in each year from 2004 through 2018, is taken from the 2018 version of the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) digest of UK energy statistics (DUKES) <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/electricity-chapter-5-digest-of-united-kingdom-energy-statistics-dukes">chapter five</a>,<a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/731591/DUKES_5.11.xls"> table 5.11</a>. Location data was taken from BEIS and cross-checked against other sources.</p>
                    <p>Plants were assigned to fuels and types, for example, &ldquo;gas, combined cycle&rdquo; or &ldquo;waste, anaerobic digestion&rdquo;. The waste category includes waste biomass such as landfill gas or sewage sludge digestion. Biomass covers plant biomass, including wood pellets. Oil includes diesel. Storage includes batteries, pumped hydro, flywheels and compressed air.</p>
                    <p>Various errors in the data were identified and corrected during the development of the map. Some locations had to be added manually.</p>
                    <p>Data on large-scale renewables of at least 1MW capacity was taken from the March 2019 version of the BEIS <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/renewable-energy-planning-database-monthly-extract">renewable energy planning database</a> quarterly extract. Locations were converted from Ordnance Survey X/Y coordinates to latitude/longitude using a <a href="http://altons.github.io/python/2012/12/01/converting-northing-and-easting-to-latitude-and-longitude/">Python script</a>.</p>
                    <p>Data on small-scale renewables is drawn from the March 2019 publication of the <a href="https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/">Ofgem</a> Feed-in Tariffs quarterly <a href="https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/environmental-programmes/fit/contacts-guidance-and-resources/public-reports-and-data-fit/installation-reports">installation reports</a>. This contains partial location data on each individual project funded through the FiTs scheme, including solar rooftops on residential properties. For the map, these schemes have been aggregated, by technology, at local authority level.</p>
                    <p>Carbon Brief is grateful to <a href="https://www.renewableuk.com/">RenewableUK</a> for sharing data on the location of battery storage sites from its <a href="https://www.renewableuk.com/page/ProjectIntelligenceHome">Project Intelligence database</a>. The locations of current and planned electricity interconnectors are based on Carbon Brief&rsquo;s own research.</p>
                    <p>Data on combined heat and power (CHP) plants was drawn from a <a href="https://chptools.decc.gov.uk/chp/public">BEIS database</a>. This does not include information on when sites opened so all are assumed to have been commissioned before 2008 and to continue operating throughout the map timeline. Sites in the data are located by postcodes, which were match to <a href="https://github.com/dwyl/uk-postcodes-latitude-longitude-complete-csv">latitude/longitude</a> using Python. Some 99 sites of less than 1MW capacity were excluded as were six sites without a postcode match. These exclusions total 50MW.</p>
                    <p>Carbon Brief is grateful to <a href="https://www.auroraer.com/">Aurora Energy Research</a> for providing a database of small gas and diesel plant contracted under the <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/qa-what-next-for-uk-capacity-market-after-surprise-eu-ruling">UK capacity market</a> as of April 2018. This data does not include information on when plants started operating. Existing sites are assumed to have been commissioned before 2008. New sites are assumed to open in the year of their earliest contract.</p>
                    <p>Overall carbon intensity figures are based on Carbon Brief analysis of <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/electricity-section-5-energy-trends">annual generation by fuel</a> and conversion factors for coal, oil and gas from <a href="https://electricinsights.co.uk/#/reports/methodology?_k=2rvgvt">Electric Insights</a>. To align with government accounts, emissions associated with the production of fuel overseas are not included.</p>
                    <p>This applies to <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/seven-charts-showing-countries-carbon-footprints">fugitive emissions</a> during overseas extraction of coal or gas, as well as changes in land or forest carbon stocks from biomass harvests, which <a href="https://electricinsights.co.uk/#/reports/methodology?_k=2rvgvt">can be significant</a>. The intensity figures are for electricity generated in the UK. Therefore, <a href="https://www.green-alliance.org.uk/resources/better_connected.pdf">imports via interconnector</a> are also excluded.</p>
                    <p>Overall capacity and generation data is taken from <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/energy-trends">BEIS energy trends</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/digest-of-uk-energy-statistics-dukes">DUKES</a>, including archived tables published in previous years. This is supplemented where necessary by Carbon Brief analysis of the combined data behind the map and other sources.</p>
                    <p>The &ldquo;future&rdquo; view in the map is based on the following assumptions: <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-uk-auction-offshore-wind-cheaper-than-new-gas">contracted renewables</a> all get built; the <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/countdown-to-2025-tracking-the-uk-coal-phase-out">coal phaseout</a> is completed; <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/qa-can-the-uk-meet-its-climate-goals-without-the-wylfa-nuclear-plant">nuclear retirements and newbuild</a> proceed as currently scheduled; no currently operating gas or renewable schemes retire (see discussion, above).</p>
                    <p>Future capacity and generation figures in the associated charts are based on the Committee on Climate Change &ldquo;<a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/ccc-new-uk-renewables-could-be-cheaper-than-existing-gas-plants-by-2030">central renewables</a>&rdquo; scenario for 2030, published in 2017.</p>
